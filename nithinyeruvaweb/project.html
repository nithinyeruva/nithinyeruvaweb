<p class="project1"> Automated Programming and Testing Fixture for Electronics Manufacturing @Douglas Innovation </p>
<p class="what0">What?</p>
<ul class="what1">
  <li>Tasked to design and fabricate a device that programs and tests electronics in a factory environment</li>
  <li>Given coordinates for precision gold pins to be in contact with the board </li>
</ul>




<div class="inside">

</div>

<p class="how0">How?</p>
<ul class="how1">
  <li>Used Autodesk Inventor to design and CAM works to program CNC to create electronic board mounting due to the needs of precision </li>
  <li>The main body which was 3D printed, went through various iterations to achieve peak efficiency and strength </li>
  <li>Used soldering skills to attach gold contact pins and the following wires to the control box which programmed the board </li>
</ul>

</div>

<p class="results0">Results</p>
<ul class="results1">
  <li>Manufactured many models to send to plant in Mexico</li>
  <li>Attached clamps on both sides of the board so the electronic board would stay in constant contact with the gold pins</li>
  <li>Placed programing controller at the bottom of the box to reduce the footprint of the device</li>
</ul>
